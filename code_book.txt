===========

This is processed and tidy-ed data from the original experimental data for wearables found here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The original data had the following files:
a. A table of wearables measurements (more on this later)
b. A corresponding list of activity codes (eg. 1 == WALKING)
c. A corresponding list of test subject codes (represented by numbers)

The data was split into "test" and "train" - the latter was used to train a ML algorithm and the test data set was used to evaluate the ML. 

The measurements in the original data were described as (see the file "features_info.txt in the data zip file for more info):

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

augmented with:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

So a data set with label "tBodyAcc-X-mean()" would represent the mean values for the tBodyAcc measurement on the X axis.

Data Set Description
====================
The data in the data set is processed from this data set. 

The work that was done was:
a. merged the test and train data sets
b. added the Subject and Activity columns to correspond with the measurements
c. Activity data points were converted to labels from code (to be descriptive) 
d. All columns are labelled (to be descriptive)
e. From the final data set, we created an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Column Descriptions
===================

Activity: the activity measured eg. WALKING
Subject: the test subject code eg. 5 for subject #5

The rest of the columns are for the average measurements for each Activity and Subject pair:

eg. tBodyAcc-mean()-X for Subject = 1 and Activity "WALKING" would be the average value for the tBodyAcc-X mean measurement for Subject 1 in the "WALKING" Activity.
